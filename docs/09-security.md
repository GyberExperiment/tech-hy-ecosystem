# Security and Audit

## Introduction

Security is a critically important aspect of developing the TECH-HY ecosystem on BSC. This document describes security measures recommended at all stages of development, potential risks and vulnerabilities, as well as a plan for conducting smart contract audits.

## Potential Risks and Vulnerabilities

### 1. Overflow and Underflow of Integer Values

**Risk**: Operations with tokens can lead to overflow or underflow of integer values, which can result in incorrect calculations or loss of funds.

**Defense Measures**:
- Use safe mathematical operations through the `anchor_spl::math` library
- Check the results of arithmetic operations before applying them
- Use types with sufficient range to store all possible values

### 2. Transaction Replay

**Risk**: An attacker can intercept and resend a transaction, leading to unauthorized operation execution.

**Defense Measures**:
- Use unique nonces for each transaction
- Check that the transaction has not been executed before
- Use the latest versions of BSC runtime and Anchor

### 3. Frontrunning

**Risk**: Validators or observers can see transactions before they are executed and insert their transactions before them, gaining an advantage from information about future operations.

**Defense Measures**:
- Use atomic transactions
- Add random value to transaction parameters to make prediction difficult
- Implement mechanisms to protect against price manipulation

### 4. Unauthorized Access to Administrative Functions

**Risk**: Unauthorized access to contract management functions can lead to parameter changes or loss of funds.

**Defense Measures**:
- Strict signature and role checks for all administrative operations
- Use multi-signature for critical operations
- Implement delayed functions for important changes

### 5. Business Logic Errors

**Risk**: Business logic implementation errors can lead to system malfunction and loss of funds.

**Defense Measures**:
- Thorough testing of all use cases
- Formal code verification of critical parts
- Gradual deployment with limited functionality

### 6. Attacks on Oracles and External Integrations

**Risk**: Manipulation of oracle data or vulnerabilities in integrated services can disrupt the system.

**Defense Measures**:
- Use multiple data sources
- Check data correctness before using it
- Limit external data influence on critical operations

## Security Development Strategy

### Security Development Principles

1. **Least Privilege Principle**:
   - Each account should have only the privileges necessary to perform its tasks
   - Administrative functions should be strictly limited

2. **Protection from Known Attacks**:
   - Protection against reentrancy attacks
   - Protection against flash loan attacks
   - Protection against price manipulation attacks

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Validation of all input parameters
   - Check boundary conditions
   - Handle exceptional situations

4. **Component Isolation**:
   - Modular architecture with clearly defined interfaces
   - Restricting variable and function scope
   - Minimizing component dependencies

### Security Development Process

1. **Security Design**:
   - Documenting threat models
   - Identifying trusted and untrusted data sources
   - Identifying critical components and operations

2. **Safe Coding**:
   - Following best practices for coding on BSC and Anchor
   - Using verified libraries and templates
   - Commenting complex and critical code parts

3. **Continuous Testing**:

   - Testing boundary conditions and exceptional situations
   - Fuzzing testing for uncovering unexpected vulnerabilities

4. **Code Quality Control**:
   - Code review by colleagues
   - Static code analysis
   - Scanning for known vulnerabilities

   - Check the results of mathematical operations before applying them
   - Handle errors in case of failed mathematical operations

2. **Authorization Check**:
   - Validate token owner account before performing operations
   - Check program token match

3. **Transaction Reuse Protection**:
   - Use unique nonces for each transaction
   - Check transaction timestamps
   - Update nonce after use

### Burn and Earn Security

1. **Atomic Operations**:
   - Performing the entire VC to LP token conversion and VG token creation process in one transaction
   - Check all conditions before starting the process
   - Cancel the entire transaction in case of error at any stage

2. **Manipulation Protection**:
   - Limit maximum transaction size
   - Check market impact
   - Prevent price manipulation

### Staking Security

1. **Staking Period Validation**:
   - Validate staking period end before allowing withdrawal
   - Check staking status to prevent repeated withdrawal

2. **Safe NFT Booster Use**:
   - Validate NFT booster ownership
   - Validate NFT booster status
   - Prevent repeated use of NFT booster

### DAO Security

1. **Two-step Execution of Critical Proposals**:
   - Prepare critical proposal with status check
   - Cooling period before execution
   - Cancellation possibility in case of errors

## Exception Handling

### Emergency Stop

In case of vulnerability discovery, the system must have an emergency stop mechanism:

- Authorization check via multi-signature

## Conclusion

Security is a priority in developing the TECH-HY ecosystem and VC/VG tokens on BSC. A comprehensive security approach, including security design, safe coding, thorough testing, and independent audit, will help minimize risks and ensure system reliability.

Security audit plan involves staged contract verification as they are developed, allowing vulnerabilities to be identified and addressed early. Attracting independent auditors with experience in BSC contract auditing will provide additional confidence in system security.

Implementing technical security measures, such as safe mathematical operations, atomic transactions, authorization check, and manipulation protection, will prevent most common attacks on smart contracts.

Continuous monitoring of smart contract activity and readiness for proactive response to incidents will ensure system security after launching on main network.
